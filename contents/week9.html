                    If your team is facing difficulties due to differences in skill/motivation/availability among team 
                    members, read 
                        <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.google.com/document/d/1sXGYn1hsdZivB-IU4EL9_KhaLuWGpNM8PAJ-0_rxeYE/pub?embedded=true">

                <li>
                    If you find some team members messing up the team repo frequently, you can attempt the 
                    safer (but a bit more complicated) workflow described in the 'A safer workflow using forks and 
                    pull requests' section of the

                    Until now, stronger coders in the team may have written code in all components of the 
                    product, to get the product up and running. It is fine for strong programmers take such initiative 
                    in getting the product off the ground. However, as the product gets more stable, try to limit your 
                    work to your own components only. When you need changes in a component handled by 
                    another team member, ask that member to do the change. While this may slow down your 
                    progress a bit, it is an essential part of working in a team. Editing others' code freely might affect 
                    your team's morale too.

                <ul>
                <li>
                    Have a look at past papers (links given in the handbook) and note how the questions are 
                    related to what you are doing in the project. This should motivate you to work harder in the 
                    project. If you do the project well, you will do the exam well too. 
                    Have a look at V0.5 grading criteria (given in the handbook). In particular, note how we have 
                    allocated marks for project management. Those who use the issue tracker well can earn more 
                    marks.

            <h3>[Individual, 2pts] Relate patterns and principles to the project </h3>
            <div>
                Identify patterns and principles (at least one principle and one pattern) related to your part of 
                the project. You should be able to explain the identified patterns and principles using diagrams 
                in the project manual V0.1. This is also a good test of whether your project manual V0.1 has 
                enough diagrams. If it doesn't, make a note to add more diagrams for the next project manual 
                submission.
                Optionally, you may discuss your findings with your team and refine further before coming to 
                the tutorial. It is OK if you haven't actually applied these patterns/principles to the project yet. 
                You can still describe how you could have applied them or even why you would not apply them 
                for a particular scenario.
